			<h3>Objective</h3>
        	<p>To use the MP Track data from PRS website on the 15th Lok Sabha to show a series of visualizations that capture the state of the Indian Lok Sabha. The data is in Excel and contains several things such as the political party to which the MPs belong, their educational qualifications, age, and most interestingly their activity in parliament -- attendance, debates in which they participated, questions they raised in parliament, etc.</p>
        	<p>Our main idea to allow exploration and mashup of different parameters together. And the main goal in the statistics part is to mathematically describe any interesting trends have been spotted in the visualizations.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Implementation of Idea</h3>
        	<p>In order to achieve our objective, we have used "Google Charts" to draw various Histograms, Pie Charts, Scatter plots, Geo maps, Tables,etc. to bring out interesting trends and patterns.</p>
